<h1>Reasons why Mountain View is attractive</h1>
<p>I have spent 3 days in Mountain View which is famous for google HQ. David, the father of my host family took me to a lot of place and introduced many of his friends. They all are really nice people.</p>
<p>This city is really nice. Most people are happy and kind, weather is good,  there're a lot of good restaurants, and it is quiet. People are smart. Children are growing up carefree.</p>
<p>The interesting fact is technology created this place. Most people around here have jobs related to technology. They are engineer, workers of technology companies, investor of them, and so on. Technology has some interesting characteristics. One of them is it can be valuable everywhere in the world. Technology created in one place can get a lot of money from all over the world. So it is gathering here. Most of them have more than enough money and people related to technology tend to prefer intellect than consuming something so they are generous and use those money to make environment better. That makes this city really good place.</p>
