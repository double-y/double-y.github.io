<p>Halloween is a very big event in the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> In San Francisco, there were many people who wear costumes in the town. From 26<span class="ord">th</span> to 30<span class="ord">th</span>, materials which was used in my class was related to it and on 29<span class="ord">th</span>, there was a party. Therefore, I learned a lot about&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>It has a long history. It exists before Christ. The day was thought to be a day which the distance between the world after death and this world become smallest. To stay away from evil souls from there, people made a fire. Later, catholic merged the custom and made it as the day for dead&nbsp;souls.</p>
<p>I went to a parade in the Castro street on Saturday with friends. The street was filled with monsters and crazy people. Some costumes were really creative and interesting. The street is famous for gay people so some people wore flashy costumes with a lot of exposure too. It was also a good experience which is difficult to find in&nbsp;Japan.</p>
<p>Last week was in festival mood so I have to switch to the normal&nbsp;life. </p>
