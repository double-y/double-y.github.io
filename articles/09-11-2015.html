<p>I met a man who got doctor degree in my laboratory and who is working for Apple. I talked about my situation and asked about his job in Apple. He gave me a lot of good advice in the&nbsp;conversation.</p>
<p>I have much curiosity. Sometimes, it is good but sometimes it’s bad. It makes me try new things and I can get some new perspectives. However, it often changes what I’m concentrating on. As a result, my knowledge and skills are broad but shallow. To work for big companies like Google, Micro Soft, Apple, people who have deep knowledge and skill are better because jobs are separated into small pieces. But in small company, people who can do various things tend to be valuable because situation changes easily and the cost to look for a people who is suitable for it is relatively bigger compared to the scale of their&nbsp;business.</p>
<p>I’ve been putting off the decision what kind of career I’ll choose. I’m thinking that I should think about it now. Where I want to live, what company I want to work for and what kind of job I want to do. Depending on them, what I should do in San Francisco changes. I already spend more than one month. I have to design the lest of nine month as I won’t&nbsp;regret.</p>
