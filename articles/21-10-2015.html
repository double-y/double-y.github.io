<p>Today, I had to speak in front of other students. The theme was free so I chose my major. I knew it is very difficult because I had to explain many technical terms and some mathematical concepts but I thought it would be good practice so I tried. As expected, it was very difficult and I couldn’t finish my explanation because it took long time for other students to understand some words. It was more hard to explain them than I expected. That’s partly because my English was not good enough but it is not the only reason. The students’ backgrounds are various and most of them is not good at math and science. I tended to be with people who is studying science or who have at least basic knowledge taught in high school. I think those people could understand my explanation but guessing from reactions of other people, most people can’t understand. Many people probably can’t convert mathematical description to image and vice&nbsp;versa.</p>
<p>If you can’t do so, the world which you can imagine will be limited. Numbers make our world more easy to analyze and understand. And the biggest problem is children are not taught the fact. Human is better at thinking without it so people tend to avoid it but you will hit the wall if you can’t use it as tool. I really think that it was a very good choice to study it hard. In my opinion, every children should study math until they realize it is a very excellent language. It is a big challenge but if you overcome, a very interesting and exciting world is&nbsp;spreading.</p>
