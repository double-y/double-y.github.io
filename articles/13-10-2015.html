<p>A friend of mine introduced a Japanese person who is working for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation">Oracle</a> so I visited it. Oracle is a company which is making software for enterprises. Different from Japanese companies, ones in Silicon Valley have huge land. Oracle office is especially big. There are a lot of buildings. It even have a big pond in the&nbsp;land.</p>
<p>The impression of the office is clean and rigid. Outside of buildings are like metallic coating so it’s overwhelming. It’s like a modern fortress. There are places to have fun like gym, pool and billiard. But the atmosphere is somehow serious. Other software company where I have been to try to make their office full of fun. The difference are probably from the style of service. Most companies which I have been before are web service ones like twitter and airbnb. For them, it is critically important to make their service interesting. They have to entertain customers. On the other hand, Oracle’s customers are companies. They don’t want entertainment. They want services which accurately works and useful to make profit. The most important thing is trust from&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>The difference of culture was the most interesting part of today’s activity. The person who guided the company was very kind and nice. It must be a valuable&nbsp;meeting.</p>
