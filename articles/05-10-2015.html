<p>I went to Stanford University today. A friend of mine introduced a student who is senior of Electric Engineering department so I met him. He was very kind. He has very interesting background. He is a fifth‐generation American of Japanese descent. His mother is electric engineer and his father is a professor of Stanford. He grew up in Stanford University. We talked about what we are doing and what we are going to do. It was very interesting. I also told what I want to do in San Francisco. He said he will help me as much as he can so it was very&nbsp;encouraging.</p>
<p>The campus of Stanford is really big and beautiful. It’s like one town or city. Surprisingly, there is a big shopping center. At first, I thought it sells goods related to Stanford but it was just a normal shopping center or department store. He said most Stanford students lives most time in the campus. He can buy almost everything in the campus and there are a lot of dorms. The life in Stanford seems very attractive. Because you can live in the good campus, you can focus on studying and research. People are very smart and creative. I started to think about going there to study. It must be very difficult in both economical and intellectual aspects&nbsp;though.</p>
