<p>I moved from host family’s house to a youth hostel today. My room is a share room with a Syrian. When I entered the room, he was not there but his belongings were in the room. On the table, there was a small bottle of powder so I thought he might use some drug. After a while, he came up. I still don’t know he use drug or not but he was a good guy. Anyway, he seems to live long in the dorm so probably don’t cause any&nbsp;troubles.</p>
<p>I was in a share room of a dorm when I was in high school so I’m not worried about whether I can adapt or not. However, there seems to be some groups exist so I’m a little worried about getting into those communities. I also don’t like I sometimes hear Japanese. I want to be soaked into English now so this may not be a good environment. I will stay here just four weeks so it’s not a big&nbsp;deal.</p>
