<p>Halloween is very big event in the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> and it is in this week so teachers in my school provide us with materials which are related to&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>In today’s class, we talked about fairly tails and legends in our home countries because many characters are in them. I remembered I read a lot of fantasy stories in childhood. I think it made me more imaginative. When reading them, I imagine the situations and the feelings of characters from words. If you can do it, they bring me to another world. It’s very&nbsp;fun.</p>
<p>The ability of understanding is deeply related to imagination. Many people think that science is different from stories which is described by words but there is a very similar aspect. We need to use our imagination to enjoy&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Numbers and equations are also language. They mean something and it can be interpreted to normal language. If you are not familiar with them, you are just not used to them like languages which you haven’t learn. The more you learn some languages, the more you can enjoy contents written by them. It’s the same with&nbsp;science.</p>
<p>Imagination is one of the most important and basic ability. Children should have more opportunity to train&nbsp;it.</p>
