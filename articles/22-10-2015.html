<p> Today, I talked with people who is making a new product and new business. They talked about what they are trying to develop and why they are doing. I mainly listened to their talk. One of them said I was good at listening. I think I’m very good at listening in some cases and in other cases, I’m not. Only when I’m interested in the topic, I think I’m a good listener. I’m not usually interested in facts themselves. I like academic talk and I usually talk in their field. My strengths are curiosity, extensive knowledge and thought. I’m not quick-witted but I’m good at thinking deeply and find essence. If you show interest, tell that you have basic knowledge and sometimes you say what you thought, people will tell you very interesting story. I really like talking like this. I think people who is thinking a lot also like it and who don’t won’t like it. I want to talk more with thoughtful people so this method is very&nbsp;useful.</p>
