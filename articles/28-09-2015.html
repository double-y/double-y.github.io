<p>As you can know from the name, the most typical characteristics is the bay. It helped a lot of immigrants to come&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>In 1949, a lot of people headed to San Francisco because gold was found in mountains around there. It is west coast so they came from Pacific Ocean. Many of them were foreigners. But the gold soon ran out. They lost their job. They are far from home and they only had ships so they started&nbsp;fishing.</p>
<p>Because people from all over the world gathered here, a lot of ways of thinking was accepted here. Vietnam war started in 1955. A lot of young people started to protest against it. They are called hippie. They came to San Francisco to avoid suppression. What they care was not political issues. It was happiness of&nbsp;everyone.</p>
<p>It’s also related to technology culture in Bay Area. They were eager to find ways to make life better. So they repeated trial and error by themselves. Those culture are represented by <a href="http://www.wholeearth.com/index.php">whole earch catalogue</a>. It is similar to hack which often occurs from some individuals’ trial and error. It supports the culture of Silicon&nbsp;Valley.</p>
