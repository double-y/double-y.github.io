<p>I met a person working in <a href="https://www.fitbit.com/">Fitbit</a> today. He is working as data scientist and I’m also studying data science so it was vary interesting. He took me a bar and some people who is working in the company gathered there so I talked a lot with those people&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>He asked me some difficult but important questions. One of them is the reason why I’m interested in data science. Even explaining is Japanese is difficult but I had to talk in English. It is a long story so I’ll write someday as one article. What I want to say here is it was really good opportunity to convert my thought into words. They are very tolerant even for my poor English and they reply very well. My head got more clear thanks to&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>They are also very passionate for what they are doing. Even in bar and when they are drinking, they talk about what they can do better. I like those people. I felt that I want to work with passionate people who like thinking and&nbsp;learning.</p>
