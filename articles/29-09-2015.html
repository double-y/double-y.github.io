<p>Today I took the first class in my school. My test score was not bad so I entered an advanced&nbsp;class.</p>
<p>That class has 6 students. Two Japanese (including me), two Germany, one Korean, one Italian. Their level of English was good. From the start of the class, we were made to be 2 circle with 3 students and talk about where we want to go to. It was about 30 minutes and after that, we shared what we talked. The teacher feedback what we share and our English. She was strict about pronunciation. It is good for me because my pronunciation is bad. I think a lot of Japanese people have similar problem. In Japanese education, weight of pronunciation is light and there’s many sounds which Japanese don’t&nbsp;have.</p>
<p>We had grammar and reading class but the teacher made us read sentences aloud and corrected them. My pronunciation was corrected a lot of times. This experience was new to me because people don’t care much if my pronunciation is bad or good. They may care but they usually don’t say so. Improving my pronunciation on this timing will be good for my future. If I start to work and get used to wrong English, it will be difficult to improve it. There’s a lot of international people so I may not need to care much about pronunciation but it is better to have skill of speaking English which is easy to listen. I’m thinking that this school was good choice for me&nbsp;now.</p>
