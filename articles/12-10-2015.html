<p>Today, I didn’t have any special plan so I studied by myself. Basically, I talk with other students and listen to Teacher’s English so I tried to supplement those&nbsp;practice.</p>
<p>I have two motivation which is not satisfied by those&nbsp;classes.</p>
<p>First, I’m a university student so I want also study my major. I looked for some ways to kill two birds with one&nbsp;stone.</p>
<p>Second, I want to get used to normal speed for native speaker. In classroom, students are non-native speakers so they try to speak slowly and clearly and teachers  also speak as we can easily understand. But the sound of conversation among native speakers is very fast and vague. I looked for materials to practice those&nbsp;sounds.</p>
<h2 id="coursera">Coursera</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> is a service which provides with online lectures. Those kind of services are getting more popular. <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a> is also famous because you can take lectures in famous university like Harvard or <span class="caps">MIT</span>. In Coursera, there is a famous lecture of algorithm which is very important part in my major provided by Stanford University so I’m studying on it. I some base knowledge so it’s very good for English practice and&nbsp;review.</p>
<h2 id="reading-technical-books-aloud">Reading technical books&nbsp;aloud</h2>
<p>I can find a lot of technical books or information related to my major online so I read them aloud. Inevitably I have to read slowly and carefully so I have room to think about contents. There are a lot of technical words whose pronunciation is difficult so it is good practice for&nbsp;it.</p>
<h2 id="movies-and-dramas">Movies and&nbsp;Dramas</h2>
<p>The most natural spoken English is in movies and dramas. In order to make scenes natural, actors and actresses have to behave naturally. Consequently, their English is very natural. There are various situations in movies so I can learn how English changes in different circumstances. It’s very difficult but they are also interesting so it’s easy to continue this practice. I want to be able to understand them without&nbsp;subtitles.</p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>In my opinion, music is also a good material for listening. You can learn the connection of sounds and the rhythm of English. Singing is also very good practice to speak smoothly. Nowadays, you can easily search lyrics on the internet. <a href="http://www.shazam.com/">Shazam</a> is easy to use for that purpose. If you use iphone or smartphone, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.syncpower.PetitLyrics&amp;hl=en">PetitLyrics</a> is a good application. It show lyrics synchronized with&nbsp;music.</p>
