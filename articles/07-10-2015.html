<p>I have lived in a host family for last 2 weeks in Mountain View. The father is a engineer who is working for a chip company and the mother is a professor of Stanford law department. They have three children and two of them are twins. They like soccer very much. They helped me to get used to the life in the&nbsp;<span class="caps">U.S.</span></p>
<p>I was very lucky because I experienced a life of typical upper class American family. They have big house and three cars. In the garden, there are a lot of plants like berries and apple trees. The father often work remote so he is in the house on such days. Sometimes the father cooks and sometimes the mother does. It depends on their job. They buy a lot on weekends for groceries for one or two weeks. They hire a nanny who is a university student. They often meet friends and family who live nearby. They talk about various topics like their jobs, politics and football. It was very good time for me. I want to be a host of students&nbsp;someday.</p>
