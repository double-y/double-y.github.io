<p>In this weekends, I participated in <a href="http://hackingedu.co/">this event</a>. This kind of events which people get together and develop some applications are called hackathon. This was my first one so there were a lot of learning&nbsp;experiences.</p>
<p> I was amazed by the number of participants first. It was around 2000. Some people were from far places like Boston. Most people were college students but some people were high school students and some people were professionals. I thought finding a team after the event starts is normal but many people were already in team so at first, I was alone and wandered the ground. Later, a person talked to me about his idea and he invited to his team so I joined it. He was not a student but a <span class="caps">CEO</span> of a startup company. He was very good programer and very good&nbsp;person.</p>
<p>Hackathon is a compound word of hack and marathon. What I have to do is make a good product and you can do almost anything at anytime. There were some speech from famous company so if you want, you can go to the booth and if you don’t, you can continue making their product. You can sleep anywhere and anytime but there were no bed so we had to sleep in a sleeping bag but most people were awake until late. I also didn’t sleep on&nbsp;Saturday.</p>
<p>There were many sponsor which are looking for good programmer so it is perfectly free. Food and some snacks were also provided. I saved the living expenses thanks to&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Every team had to make a presentation about their product to committees. According to the evaluation, top ten team were decided and they had to show their demo to everyone. Thanks to skillful teammates we were selected as one of them. However, we failed to show demo because of trouble with the monitor so we couldn’t get any&nbsp;prize.</p>
<p>The result was a little disappointing but I learned a lot from this event and I got a little more confidence about my English skill because I made a software without Japanese. I want to participate in other hackathon in&nbsp;someday.</p>
