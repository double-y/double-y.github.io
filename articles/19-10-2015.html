<p>I met a friend of mine yesterday. He is now working and he came to San Francisco as English training in his company. We went to a mexican restaurant. With tacos and sangria which is a popular menu in the restaurant, we talked a&nbsp;lot.</p>
<p>He is working as a sales of engine for machines used in agriculture. He studied economics and very good at drawing and design. He has various faces so the conversation was very&nbsp;interesting.</p>
<p>The most impressive topic was design. He is thinking that his strength is the ability of it. I also think that it is very&nbsp;important.</p>
<p> San Francisco is famous for design. A lot of successful company is started by good designers. Jack Dorsey who is one of founders of twitter is the most famous example. It is a very efficient way to refine your thought. Sadly, people often think it is just making beautiful things. In some industries like fashion, it is also important but it is not the most crucial goal. It is to help people do what they want to do. Ideally, it allow people to use something without thinking from the&nbsp;beginning.</p>
<p> It is very difficult because usefulness and complexity tend to be trade-off. To reach to good design, you have to deeply think about how to simplify it. It’s like looking for a truth. It is very important for a lot of&nbsp;fields.</p>
<p> Interestingly, it is very difficult for computer. It is very good at dealing with a lot of data but not good at simplifying so the ability to design will be more and more important. I’m looking for great jobs which the friend of mine will&nbsp;archive.</p>
