<p>I was invited to a dinner by host family so I participated. It was with a family of a brother of the host father. They are also very nice people but I had a&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>When conversation starts among them, it is really fast and topics are difficult to understand for a foreign outsider like me. Itâ€™s difficult to ask them about those things while they are talking. Moreover, they are smart people so I should have knowledge excite their&nbsp;curiosity.</p>
<p>I felt an importance of listening ability, knowledge itself and skill to talk about them. I will make archiving those skills one of my&nbsp;goal.</p>
