<p>Today, it was in San Francisco so I went with a friend in my school. A teacher told us a good place which you can watch very well. The performance is above the bay between Golden Gate Bridge and Bay Bridge. We watched it from a hill where you can overlook there. There were a lot of audience. Many sailing boats were on the bay too. The performance was very exciting. The harmony of their movements was&nbsp;amazing.</p>
<p>A teacher said one of a big purpose of this event is recruiting. They are trying to attract young people’s mind by this spectacular show. Actually, it was really cool so some people may try to be a&nbsp;serviceman.</p>
