<p>I went an information session of <a href="http://www.productschool.com/">Product School</a> today. I found the event on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/">meetup</a>. In Japan, school of Product Management is rare so I went out of&nbsp;curiosity.</p>
<p>It was more interesting than I expected. Product management is a job to integrate business, design and technology to make good product.　It’s very important job but the opportunities you can study how to do it is very rare. Companies are always looking for good product managers. On the other hand, people who want to become a product manager don’t know what they should do. The payment of the job is very good so people are willing to the fee. Their business must be very&nbsp;profitable.</p>
<p>However, they also said that to be a good product manager, making products is the best practice. I have skill to make products so the school is not so attractive for me. To make some connections and to get mentor, it might be good opportunities but I think they are not so valuable compared to the fee. But they said they sometimes hold hackathons so it may be good to participate in. I want to find good&nbsp;partners.</p>
