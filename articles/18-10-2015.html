<p>I like programming and I think it is very good for your brain. It enables you to think more efficiently. The origin of the word is the combination of “pro” which means “before” and “graphein” which means “write” in Greek. If you search “program” in  <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/program">dictionary.com</a>, you can find that the first meaning of program is “a plan of action to accomplish a specified end”. It’s not code. To clear the meanings I’ll use “code” as machine language and “coding” to describe writing code. According to the meaning, code is a written plan to archive something. People write programs assuming that someone will use them to solve their problems. It is very good training in some&nbsp;aspects.</p>
<h2 id="imagination">Imagination</h2>
<p>Code is used in the future so people who write it have to imagine how it works in the future. There are a lot of uncertainty. After writing code, the demand may change and it may also have to be altered. Therefore, the more  adaptable the code is, the better it is although it’s more difficult and you need more time to do so. You have to imagine how people will want to use&nbsp;it.</p>
<h2 id="organization-of-your-thought">Organization of your&nbsp;thought</h2>
<p>To write code, you have to organize your thought. There are usually much variation in problems which it have to solve. You have to isolate and organize them well but know-hows to do so are accumulated and they are also useful for other things than&nbsp;coding.</p>
<h2 id="order">Order</h2>
<p>Order is very important for coding. It is processed by step by step so you have to divide the process and assemble orderly. Moreover, you have to write it as other people can easily understand. Breaking down the procedure and bringing together as others can easily understand is very important when you explain something. It is an ability everyone&nbsp;needs.</p>
